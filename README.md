I don't incorporate language parsers, as a rule.  
(To be precise, I have installed and configured it up to tree-sitter.)  
The reasons are as follows:
- When coding at that level, I use an IDE, currently Code OSS.
- For me, it is difficult to install and configure.
- However, I would like a completion function for variables, functions, etc. that I type.
- To be honest, I'm not at a skill level where I can even install a normal plugin and get it to work properly.
